# web_scraping_challenge

What the project does: This project enables the review and scraping of Mars news content using the part_1_mars_news.ipynb. The second part of the project analyzes various Martian data points (such as pressure, temperature, etc.) to provide a high-level analysis of Martian conditions, potentially useful for future space travel. Data for this analysis is provided in part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.

How users can get started with the project: Users can download the project, run the analysis, and evaluate the results themselves. The code facilitates scraping summaries from the Mars News website and exporting Martian weather conditions for further analysis and review.

Resources used for building the SQL project include: Multiple sources were referenced, including official Bootcamp course materials, instructor-led classes and shared resources, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, as well as support and guidance from Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
